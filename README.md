# tower-of-hanoi-with-infinite-rods
there is a tower of hanoi recursive function with classical 3 rods. this time you decide the rod number as well as disk number

I created a self growing recursive program to avoid increasing lines of code.

There is an also mathematical formulla I derived through the outputs of the function, with n disk count and m rod count it gives you the least amount of moves required to finish the game.
